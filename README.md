# SharePoint web-parts
Here you can find my custom web-parts for Microsoft SharePoint. 

Birthday.js was used to make a CAML query for the list of employees with a filter of birthday during the last two weeks. Also, I used Bootstrap-cards in order to customize view of returned employees.

Slider.js was used to make Rest-query for images from the library and then I made a jQuery slider for returned images.
